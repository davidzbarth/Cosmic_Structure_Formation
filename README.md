Bachelor's Thesis about the Small Scale Asymptotics of the Matter Power Spectrum

The file is self-contained and will explain everything.
See here the abstract:

*The Matter Power Spectrum $P(k)$ is an important object in cosmology to study density fluctuations on different scales and times.
In the small-scale limit, we know that it decreases as $k^{-3}$.
In this thesis, we try to approach the explicit amplitude of this decay by using a two-particle model and the saddle point approximation.
These assumptions allow us to compute the amplitude analytically as we will show for both the interacting and non-interacting case.
We show that the amplitude depends on the second derivative of the interaction term in the particles' trajectories*
